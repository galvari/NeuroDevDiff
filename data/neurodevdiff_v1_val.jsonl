Cognitive screening indicates a heterogeneous profile, with relative\nstrength in visuospatial and relative weakness in attention (other domains fall in the below average range).\nKey information is currently missing (e.g., onset timeline, cross-setting symptoms (home vs school), and\ndevelopmental history), which increases diagnostic uncertainty.", "output": {"should_defer": 1, "rationale": "Defer: missing key information (onset timeline, cross-setting symptoms (home vs school), developmental history, language/pragmatics assessment) increases diagnostic uncertainty.", "questions_to_ask": ["Can we review developmental milestones (language, motor, adaptive skills) and early social communication?", "Any relevant perinatal/medical history?", "Any concerns about speech production, comprehension, or narrative skills?", "What differences do caregivers and teachers report?", "Were there any early developmental concerns (language, play, social engagement)?"], "differential_hypotheses": ["ADHD", "ANXIETY", "ASD"]}, "meta": {"case_id": 297, "true_profile": "ADHD", "risk_high": 0, "severity": "mild", "age": 6, "sex": "M"}}
